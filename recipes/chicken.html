    <!--Added ordered list-->
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.<br> Drain and discard excess grease from skillet.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Flip chicken over and place skillet in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear,<br> about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).<br> Remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.<br> Remove all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to the stove over medium-high heat.<br> Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet.<br> Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering,<br> then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Return chicken and any juices back into skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over the chicken.</li>
